# Support Vector Machine Classifier on the HIGGS Dataset

This project involves the methodology and results from the application of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models on the HIGGS dataset to classify events as signal or background. The aim of this project was to analyze and predict the presence of a Higgs boson particle, utilizing different SVM kernels to assess their performance and to perform hyperparameter tuning for optimization.
