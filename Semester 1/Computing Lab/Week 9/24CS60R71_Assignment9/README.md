## Task Overview

This assignment consists of three tasks, each represented by a separate C++ source file named as 24CS60R71_part{i}.cpp. The following are the execution commands for compiling and running each task.

### Task 1: Compile and Execute

To compile and execute the first task, use the following commands:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -o 24CS60R71_A9_part1 24CS60R71_A9_part1.cpp
./24CS60R71_A9_part1
```

### Task 2: Compile and Execute

To compile and execute the second task, use the following commands:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -o 24CS60R71_A9_part2 24CS60R71_A9_part2.cpp
./24CS60R71_A9_part2
```

### Task 3: Compile and Execute

To compile and execute the third task, which uses C++20 standard, use the following commands:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -o 24CS60R71_A9_part3 24CS60R71_A9_part3.cpp
./24CS60R71_A9_part3
```

## Prerequisites

Make sure that the GCC and G++ compilers are installed and configured properly. The assignment uses C++20 standard in Task 3, so ensure that your G++ compiler supports it.
