Performance Comparison:
Blocking execution time: 0.000471 seconds
Non-blocking execution time: 2.6e-05 seconds
-------------------------------------
1. Performance Comparison:
The non-blocking implementation showed improved concurrency compared to the traditional blocking version.
2. Structure and Management of Coroutines and Task System:
   - Tasks are submitted to a lock-free job queue managed by a thread pool.
   - Coroutine results are processed as they become available.
3. Lock-Free Techniques Used:
   - A lock-free queue is used for task submission, allowing concurrent access without blocking threads.
4. Thread Pool and Task Scheduling Structure:
   - The thread pool consists of worker threads that poll the job queue for tasks and execute them asynchronously.
5. Design of Non-blocking Job Queue:
   - The job queue is designed to support multiple concurrent enqueue and dequeue operations without blocking.
6. Challenges Faced and Solutions:
   - Managing coroutine states and ensuring thread safety was challenging. Used mutexes and atomic flags to handle synchronization.
