Hate speech in travel and tourism refers to discriminatory language or behavior targeting individuals based on their regional, linguistic, or cultural identity during travel experiences. This manifests in public transport through slurs against non-local language speakers, in hospitality via biased service toward certain demographics, and online through xenophobic travel reviews. In India, such incidents often stem from deep-seated regionalism, like hostility toward North Indians in southern states or against Bihari migrants in Maharashtra. These tensions create exclusionary environments that deter tourism, damage India's reputation as a welcoming destination, and perpetuate social divisions. Addressing this requires multi-pronged solutions including stricter enforcement of anti-discrimination laws in the tourism sector, sensitivity training for service staff, and AI-powered moderation of online travel platforms to flag hate speech while preserving cultural authenticity in traveler interactions.
